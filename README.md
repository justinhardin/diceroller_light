# Dice Roller
Diceroller is a simple p5.js sketch that rolls a 3d die and keeps track of the rolled value

## To install
1. npm install (installs dependencies)
1. npm run build (builds the dist folder)

## To run
1. npm run start (starts up a local webpack dev server)

## To use
1. This component will render inside of an element with the id 'diceroller-container'
1. One running, click anywhere in the sketch to roll. The dice will slow down and 'snap' to a face, and the fallow should appear in the lower right corner.
1. With the sketch 'in focus' hit the space bar, this will pause the roll

That's it!
